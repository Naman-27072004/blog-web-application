# 📝 Blog Web Application (Capstone Project)

This project is a **Blog Web Application** built using **Node.js, Express.js, and EJS** as part of a **Capstone Project** from *The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp*.

The application allows users to **create, view, edit, and delete blog posts**.  
Posts are stored **in memory** (no database), meaning data does not persist between sessions.  
The focus of this project is on **backend logic, templating, routing, and responsive styling**.

This capstone emphasizes:
- Independent problem solving
- Real-world project planning
- Clean UI and UX
- Practical Express & EJS usage
